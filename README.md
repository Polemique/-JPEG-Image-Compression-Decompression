# JPEG-Image-Compression-Decompression

Welcome to the JPEG Image Compression and Decompression project in Python! This repository contains an implementation of the JPEG compression and decompression algorithms, allowing you to efficiently reduce the file size of images while preserving visual quality.

JPEG compression/decompression standard algo here is a widely used image compression standard that employs a lossy compression algorithm. It is particularly effective for compressing photographic images while maintaining a visually acceptable level of quality. The JPEG compression process involves various steps, including color space transformation, discrete cosine transform (DCT) and quantization.
